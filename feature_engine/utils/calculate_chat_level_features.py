file: calculate_chat_level_features.py
---
This file defines the ChatLevelFeaturesCalculator class using the modules defined in "features".
The intention behind this class is to use these modules and define any and all chat level features here. 

The steps needed to add a feature would be to:
- First define any building blocks that the feature would need in the appropriate "features" module (like word counter).
- Define a function within the class that uses these building blocks to build the feature and appends it 
  to the chat level dataframe as columns.
- Call the feature defining function in the driver function.
